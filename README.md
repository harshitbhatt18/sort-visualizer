# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

An interactive web application that visualizes various sorting algorithms in action. This project helps users understand how different sorting algorithms work by providing a visual representation of the sorting process.

## Features

- Visualize 5 different sorting algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
- Adjustable array size
- Customizable animation speed
- Real-time visualization of comparisons and swaps
- Responsive design
- Interactive controls

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- No external libraries or frameworks

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/harshitbhatt18/sort-visualize.git
```

2. Open `index.html` in your web browser

3. Use the controls to:
   - Adjust the number of elements (array size)
   - Change the animation speed
   - Select different sorting algorithms
   - Start/Reset the visualization

## How to Use

1. Select the number of elements using the slider (20-100)
2. Adjust the animation speed using the speed slider
3. Choose a sorting algorithm
4. Click the "Play" button to start the visualization
5. Watch as the algorithm sorts the array
6. Use the "Reset" button to generate a new random array
